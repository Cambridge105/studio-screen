studio-screen
=============
This is the main information screen for use in the studio.

schedule.js contains a JSON representation of schedule data. It is committed to give an idea of the format.
In reality, it downloaded by a cronjob from our website.

micLive.js contains a JSON representation of the Mic Live status, which comes from the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi that contains this screen. (That code hasn't been committed yet).
